# VideoGame
This project is done during the CodeWithMosh React 18 for Beginners course. I pushed this project to demonstrate familiarity and skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and ChakraUI.

## Important Note
I left out the key that allows me to access an API providing me with all the video game names and images for security reasons. In general, it is good practice to never share your keys. I will attach a photo or video of the final product but otherwise, it cannot be accessed without an API key given from rawg.io
